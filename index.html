    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="lead">Precision-driven. Purpose-built.</p>

    <p>
      RENEFT was founded by <strong>Eng. Titto Varghese, PE</strong>,
      a mechanical engineer with professional experience across Europe and India.
      We design building services systems that are efficient, compliant,
      and grounded in real-world execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is guided by international standards and a belief that
      clarity, documentation, and accountability matter as much as calculations.
